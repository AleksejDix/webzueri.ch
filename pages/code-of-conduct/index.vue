          In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as

          project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
          regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex
          characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
          education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
          race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
        </p>

            Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h2>

        <p>
          Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
          acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
          corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
          behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
          or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
          contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
          temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that
          they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
        </p>

        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

        <p>
          This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
          spaces when an individual is representing the project or its
          community. Examples of representing a project or community include
          using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official
          social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
          online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further
          defined and clarified by project maintainers.
        </p>

        <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

        <p>
          Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
          may be reported by contacting the project team at the venue or write
          us a message via Meetup or
          <a href="https://twitter.com/webzurich">Twitter</a>. All complaints
          will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
          is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project
          team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
          reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
          policies may be posted separately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
          in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as
          determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
        </p>
